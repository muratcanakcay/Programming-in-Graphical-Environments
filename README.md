# Programming-in-Graphical-Environments
These are the lab tasks solved in C++ and for the 4th Semester "Programming in Graphical Environments" Class in the Computer Science B.S. program at Politechnika Warszawa. The instructions for all of the lab tasks are located in the corresponding directory.

Highlights:

Lab02 is the implementation of the game "Fruit Ninja" using WinApi32 and C++. The FruitNinjaH project in the solution is the complete game. I had a lot of fun working on this. 

Lab05 is a very basic book cover designer implemented using C# and WinForms. This was also a fun project even though it's not as "flashy" as Fruit Ninja. I learned about mouse events, keyboard events, localization and drawing on canvas. 

Lab08 is again a very basic project where I had the chance to learn about basic data binding in WPF. It was not a particularly exciting project.

Lab09 The Fourier Plotter was also a very fun project to work on. Less about data binding and more about coordinated drawing on canvas, I'm satisfied with the end result, which can be found in the "HomePart" directory.
