    <h2>Fourier Plotter</h2>
    <h4>Home Part</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="WPF14_Lab.exe">Example application</a></li>
        <li> Task description:
            <p>The purpose of the task is to create a desktop application containing 2D Plotter based on the idea of the Fourier Series. </p>
            <p>User can define list of circles with radiuses, and frequencies connected to each circle.
            First circle is anchored in the middle of plotter workspace.</p>
            <p>Each next circle center is anchored on previous one.
            After creating a list of circles user can start 10s procedure, in which each radius of each circle makes n rotations described by frequency field.</p>
            For example:
            <ul>
                <li>Circle 200, 1: a circle with a radius of 200 units, making one full clockwise rotation in 10 seconds</li>
                <li>Circle 80, -3: a circle with a radius of 80 units, making three full counter-clockwise rotations in 10 seconds</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the time of the procedure each radius of each circle is rotating from zero position proper number of times. Positions of circles have to be calculated dynamically for each step of the procedure.
            Radius of the last circle is ended with drawing pen, wchich draws curve of our final shape.</p>
